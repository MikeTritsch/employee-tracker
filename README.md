## Description

I'm excited to introduce you to the fully operational Content Management System (CMS) built using Node.js and the MySQL2 database, designed to run seamlessly in the terminal/command line. This robust CMS system allows you to manage employee information such as role, salary, manager-employee relationships, department identification and more. This application exemplifies the powerful functionality of manipulating database information to fit the needs of an organization.

## What comes next? and other issues...

Building this app was a huge undertaking for me. Through the help of collaboration and loads of research, I was able to produce something I could sign off on. As a junior developer, I am still focusing on the MVP while trying to practice good organization and DRY code. I think my use of functions within the context of a multi-facted project has improved over time, however, I still struggle with piecing things together. I feel confident in my ability to read code and understand the mechanics of the lines in front of me, but I seem to get "code-block" when I am faced with piecing everything together.

## Installation

Requires Node.js.

Uses [mySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2).

Uses the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4).

Uses [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).

Terminal Art created via [asciiart-logo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/asciiart-logo).

This application will run on both bash and terminal.
